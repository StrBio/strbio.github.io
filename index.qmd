This site contains the materials for the *Structural Bioinformatics* course of fall 2023 in the [Master's Degree in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology \@UAM](https://www-uam-es.translate.goog/Medicina/MasterBioinformaticaBiologiaComputacional/1446820907497.htm?language=es&nodepath=M?ster+Universitario+en+Bioinform?tica+y+Biolog?a+Computacional&_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp). All these materials is open access and it is shared under [CC BY-NC license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/ "CC BY-NC license"). Course syllabus is [here](2023_33082_es.pdf) (in Spanish). Detailed academic information about the course contents, dates and assessment only can be found at the UAM [Moodle](https://posgrado.uam.es/) site.

In addition to some already classic books, reviews, and articles referenced, the content of this short course is also largely inspired by the work of others who have shared their course materials, tips, and other resources on their own blogs or websites and in discussions on Twitter, including [Alexandre Bovin](https://www.uu.nl/staff/amjjbonvin), [Sergey Ovchinnikov](https://twitter.com/sokrypton), [Martin Steinegger](https://twitter.com/thesteinegger) and [Carlos Outeiral](https://twitter.com/c_outeiral?lang=es), among many others. I hace tried to acknowledge and link to each one of those contributions but I apologize in advance for those I may not have mentioned.

The course includes three hands-on exercises that will guide you through using Pymol to visualize molecules and modeling proteins through homology modeling and AlphaFold. [In addition, there are several exercises/questions in some sections that are highlighted in green to motivate you to think about the knowledge and skills you have acquired and to go a little further in interpreting the results.]{style="color:green"}

As a suggestion, I would also like to invite you to check the set of exercises on Structural Bioinformatics from the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, described in [Engelberger et al. (2021)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.1c00022): <https://github.com/pb3lab/ibm3202>

Please note that this website is a draft that is still under development, and that the earliest I can expect to have a first complete version is by the end of the semester (December 2023). Any feedback, help, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
