# Goal

```{r}

```

The goal of this exercise[^1] is to learn how to work with protein structures in
3D by using PDB files, comparing and analyzing them, and understanding the
differences between different structures.

[^1]: This exercise is inspired in the "Homology Modeling" exercise in the
    Course *Bioinformatics & Molecular Biology* by Department of Molecular
    Biosciences and Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo (UiO).
    However, this is a shorter and updated version adapted for BIBMS\@UAM.
    Please let me know if you find any mistake or trouble.

**Follow the given steps and then answer the questions in Moodle.**

Questions are very welcome, but please use the *Moodle Q&A* forum so that your
classmates can see the discussions.

# Background

As you know, viral diseases such as COVID-19, seasonal flu or the common cold
cannot be treated with antibiotics. Fortunately, there are some drugs that
target essential viral proteins and can be used instead. One example is
oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu), an inhibitor of the influenza virus
neuraminidase, whose substrate is sialic acid. In [Protein Data
Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB) there are several structures of
neuraminidases from different influenza strains and with/without complexed
substrate or inhibitors. Two of them are **2HU4** and **3CL0**.

# Procedure

### 1. Look for those structures on PDB-RCSB database and compare them.

-   You can use the tool `Structure Pairwise Alignment` from the ANALYZE menu on
    the top and test different alignment algorithms (for more info about the
    algorithms see
    <https://www.rcsb.org/docs/tools/pairwise-structure-alignment>) .

### 2. Then go to [Mol\* Viewer](https://molstar.org/viewer/) to analyze them in more detail.

+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| You can download the structures directly from PDB | ![](images/image.18.png) |
| database using the IDs.                           |                          |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| Zoom-in on the structures and see how each        | ![](images/image.9.png)  |
| protein interacts with the inhibitor. Just move   |                          |
| the mouse pointer over each residue and you will  |                          |
| easily identify them by a label on the            |                          |
| bottom-right corner.                              |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| Tips:                                             |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| -   Zoom in/out usually works with your mouse     |                          |
|     scroll                                        |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| -   Left button for rotation                      |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| -   Right button (or control+left button) for     |                          |
|     translation without rotation.                 |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| -   With SHIFT+Scroll you can move the Z-axis (I  |                          |
|     mean perpendicular to the screen plane) and   |                          |
|     show a “section plane” within the structure.  |                          |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| Trick:                                            | ![](images/image.17.png) |
|                                                   |                          |
| Click on the drug molecule and then use the right |                          |
| menu to change anything in the representation of  |                          |
| the surrounding environment of the drug.          |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| For instance, you can add labels using            |                          |
| `[Focus] Surroundings` \> `Add Representation` \> |                          |
| `Labels`                                          |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| Then click in the `...`to close that menu.        |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| Do it for one monomer in each structure to see    |                          |
| the differences in the binding pocket.            |                          |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| You can also remove water molecules and extra     | ![](images/image.12.png) |
| ions that will not be useful for us at this       |                          |
| point.                                            |                          |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+

### 3. Now we want to compare them and check the details.

+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| To align the structures:                          | ![](images/image.1.png)  |
|                                                   |                          |
| 1\. Select the “Toggle” tool                      |                          |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| 2\. Change the level for selecting to CHAIN       | ![](images/image.3.png)  |
|                                                   | ![](images/image.4.png)  |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| 3\. Select one chain from each structure.         | ![](images/image.13.png) |
|                                                   |                          |
| Tip:                                              |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| Optionally, you can remove all the unwanted       |                          |
| chains but one using the `-` option (indicated    |                          |
| with the pink arrow) to keep the exercise simpler |                          |
| by using monomeric structures.                    |                          |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| 4\. Align them with the `Superposition` tool.     | ![](images/image.6.png)  |
|                                                   |                          |
| The RMSD will be on the history bar (on the       |                          |
| bottom).                                          |                          |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+

### 4. Compare the residues in binding pocket.

::: callout-tip
Focus especially on residues 274 and 276 in each structure.

### 5. We just found a new virus with the following neuraminidase sequence:

```

```

-   Try to obtain a structural model of that protein sequence.
-   Check the target-template alignment and the model quality (Structure
    Assessment blue button).

+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| You can use SWISS-MODEL:                          | ![](images/image.10.png) |
| <https://swissmodel.expasy.org/>                  |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| All the top templates are very similar, thus you  |                          |
| can pick the first one to construct your model.   |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| Once you construct your model, you can download   |                          |
| it in PDB format.                                 |                          |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| Import your model in Mol\* using the `Open Files` | ![](images/image.15.png) |
| option in the `Home` menu (then click Apply) and  |                          |
| compare your model with the other structures.     |                          |
| Note that the numbers for equivalent residues in  |                          |
| the alignment can be different in each sequence.  |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| *Tip*: Remember also to change back the selection |                          |
| to “Residue” and switch off the *toggle* option.  |                          |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| Help: Try to solve the whole exercise yourself,   | ![](images/image.14.png) |
| but if you have trouble comparing the three       |                          |
| proteins, at this point you can view my work      |                          |
| session containing the three structures:          |                          |
| [link](mol-star_state_2023-10-3-10-33-7.molx)     |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| You can import it using the OPEN option in the    |                          |
| `Save Options` menu. *Note that this remove all   |                          |
| your previous work if unsaved.*                   |                          |
|                                                   |                          |
| After opening the session you should rotate and   |                          |
| select the drug molecules to show the binding     |                          |
| pocket in the structures. Then you can select the |                          |
| residue you want to check.                        |                          |
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+

Now, compare the position of the drug and interacting residues within the
binding pocket in structures 2HU4 (sensitive) and 3CL0 (resistant) with the
structure of the binding pocket in your model.

### 6. Go back to Moodle and answer the quiz entitled ***Structural Bioinformatics Assignment.***
